A key process in my Victoria Line Tube Map will be the ability to view live train schedules at any station on the line. 
All the user will have to do is select their chosen station on the map and choose whether they are travelling North bound or South bound. 
By selecting these choices, the user will be presented with the train schedule for their relevant station in another panel.
